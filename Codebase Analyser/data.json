        "High level Description": "High-level description of what the code aims to achieve:**\n\nThe code aims to compare two Excel files and highlight cells with differing values. It uses OpenAI's GPT-3.5-turbo model for semantic similarity comparison, which means it can identify cells that contain different words but convey the same meaning. The code then dehighlights cells that are identified as semantically similar.",
        "Method Names, Signatures, and Descriptions": "Method names, signatures, and descriptions:**\n\n* **`generate_response(text1, text2)`:** This function takes two strings as input and uses OpenAI's API to determine if they are semantically similar. However, it's currently unused in the code and seems to be a leftover from a previous implementation.\n\n* **`compare_semantic_similarity(text1, text2)`:** This function takes two strings as input and uses OpenAI's API to determine if they are semantically similar. It returns a string indicating whether they are similar (\"yes\") or not (\"no\").\n\n* **`extract_value(value)`:** This function takes a value (presumably from an Excel cell) and extracts the numeric or alphabetic part using regular expressions. It returns the extracted value or `None` if no value is found.\n\n* **`compare_excel_sheets(file1, file2)`:** This function takes two Excel file paths as input and compares the cell values in the corresponding sheets. It highlights cells with differing values and uses `compare_semantic_similarity` to dehighlight semantically similar cells. It also adds comments to the highlighted cells indicating the original value from the second file.\n\n* **`compare_excel_sheets_using_AI(file1, file2, cell_addresses)`:** This function takes two Excel file paths and a list of cell addresses as input. It compares the specified cells in both files using `compare_semantic_similarity` and dehighlights cells identified as semantically similar.",
        "Code Complexity and Ways to Improve:": "Code complexity and ways to improve:**\n\n* **Complexity:** The code is moderately complex, with nested loops and external API calls.\n* **Improvements:**\n    * **Redundancy:** The `openai.api_key` is set multiple times. This should be done only once at the beginning of the script.\n    * **Error handling:** The code lacks error handling for cases like invalid file paths or API errors.\n    * **Performance:** The code uses a `time.sleep(60)` call to avoid exceeding API rate limits. This can be improved by implementing a more efficient rate-limiting strategy using libraries like `requests`.\n    * **Modularization:** Some parts of the code, like cell highlighting and comment addition, could be extracted into separate functions for better organization and reusability.\n    * **Documentation:** Adding docstrings to explain the purpose of each function and parameter would improve readability and maintainability.\n    * **Unused function:** The function `generate_response` is unused and can be removed.",
        "Errors or Problems": "Errors or problems in the code:**\n\n* **Incorrect API call:** The function `compare_semantic_similarity` uses `openai.completions.create` for semantic similarity, but the correct call should be `openai.Embedding.create` to generate embeddings for text comparison.\n* **API Rate Limiting:** The code uses a simple `time.sleep` to manage API rate limits. This may not be ideal and can lead to delays. More robust rate limiting solutions should be explored.\n* **File save:**  The code saves the modified workbook twice, once after highlighting the cells and once after potentially dehighlighting them based on semantic similarity. This can be simplified by saving only once at the end of the process.\n* **Logic:** The function `compare_excel_sheets` first highlights cells with differing values, then attempts to dehighlight cells with semantically similar values. However, the dehighlighting logic is not entirely consistent, as the `if similarity.lower() == \"yes\":` condition only dehighlights the cells in the first sheet. The cells in the second sheet remain highlighted.\n\n**Overall:**\n\nThe code implements a basic functionality for comparing two Excel files and highlighting differing cells. However, there are several areas for improvement in terms of code structure, performance, and accuracy. Addressing the mentioned issues and implementing best practices will improve the code's robustness and efficiency."
